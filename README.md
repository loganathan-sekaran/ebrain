> A developmental artificial intelligence system that grows and learns like a human brain, starting from minimal capabilities and progressing through structured phases to achieve expert-level performance across multiple domains.

## 🧠 Overview

E-Brain is an ambitious research project to create an AI system that:

- **Starts Simple**: Begins with minimal capabilities, like a newborn
- **Grows Dynamically**: Expands its neural architecture based on learning needs
- **Learns Progressively**: Follows developmental phases mimicking human cognitive growth
- **Masters Multiple Modalities**: Processes vision, language, audio, and more
- **Self-Corrects**: Learns from feedback and teaching
- **Specializes via Cloning**: Creates domain-specific experts from foundation model
- **Transfers Knowledge**: Enables teacher-student concept transfer between models
- **Forms Ecosystems**: Builds collaborative networks of specialized AI models

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### 1. Dynamic Architecture Growth
Unlike fixed neural networks, E-Brain grows new modules and layers when needed, similar to how the brain forms new neural connections.

### 2. Developmental Phases
Learning follows human-inspired stages:
- **Phase 0**: Initialization (Birth) - Basic sensory capabilities
- **Phase 1**: Sensory Learning (0-6mo) - Pattern recognition
- **Phase 2**: Motor Control (6-18mo) - Action-consequence learning
- **Phase 3**: Language Acquisition (18mo-3yr) - Symbol grounding, communication
- **Phase 4**: Abstract Reasoning (3-7yr) - Logical thinking, transfer learning
- **Phase 5**: Expertise (7yr+) - Domain mastery, self-directed learning

### 3. Continual Learning
Prevents catastrophic forgetting through multiple strategies (EWC, A-GEM, Experience Replay, Progressive Networks).

### 4. Model Cloning
Once trained, the base model can be cloned to create specialized variants for different domains (medical, coding, games, languages) without training from scratch.

### 5. Knowledge Transfer
Models can teach each other specific concepts through a teacher-student paradigm, transferring reasoning patterns and strategies, not just parameters.
