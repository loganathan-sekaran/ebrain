# E-Brain Project Documentation

Welcome to the E-Brain project - an ambitious initiative to create a developmental AI system that grows and learns like a human brain.

## Overview

E-Brain is a developmental artificial intelligence system designed to:
- Start with minimal capabilities (like a newborn)
- Learn progressively through structured developmental phases
- Grow its architecture dynamically when needed
- Master multiple modalities (vision, language, audio, etc.)
- Self-correct through feedback and teaching
- Achieve expert-level performance in trained domains
- Clone into specialized experts for different domains
- Transfer knowledge between models like teacher and student

## Vision

Create a model that mimics human brain development, starting from basic sensory processing and progressing through language acquisition, abstract reasoning, and finally achieving expertise in any domain it's taught. Once foundational training is complete, E-Brain can be cloned to create domain specialists, and knowledge can be transferred between models through a teacher-student paradigm, enabling a collaborative ecosystem of AI models.
